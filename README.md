### Description of example song 

The example song stored in this repo aims to capture the whimisical, 

ocean wave is sampled, backwards and slower 

not all perfectly synchronized, but still cool

### How live coding was used 

At the start of the song, all of the live loops are commented out, and the 
first chord (cmin7) is the only chord not commented out. So, the only part
that plays at the beginning is the ocean wave sample. Then, bit by bit, I 
uncommented out each loop in succession, building the complexity in the 
rhythms. Each time I uncomment out a loop, I would then hit the play button 
again to layer it in to the audio output. Due to some lagging in the software, 
not all of the loops are perfectly synchronized, so the brief pause around 1:38 
is the point where I stopped and reran the code that was open at that point so 
that the intricate rhythms would line up as desired. At this point, after 
layering all of the rhythms within the first chord, I progressively engage 
each of the following 5 chords (fm7, cm, abmaj11, gmaj7, cmin7) by commenting 
out the current chord, uncommenting out the next chord, and hitting play again. 
Once the final chord is activated, I slowly layered off each of the rhythm 
complexities by including 'stop' in the most recently added loop one at a time
and hitting play to activate the stop. In the end, the first rhythm loop is the 
last one running, and then the song stops.
